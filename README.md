iDoctor is a mobile healthcare platform that helps users identify potential health issues, connect with verified doctors, and book appointments â€” all powered by AI and microservices. The app combines a **React Native frontend**, a **Spring Boot backend**, and **Flask-based machine learning microservices** to deliver personalized health insights and seamless doctor-patient interactions.

## Overview

iDoctor enables users to describe their symptoms in natural language and get **AI-powered predictions** of possible illnesses. The app then recommends **nearby doctors** specialized in those conditions, allows **direct chat with verified doctors**, and supports **appointment scheduling** with integrated calendar management for doctors.

## Features

- **Symptom-based AI diagnosis** using GPT-3.5 and Spacy for symptom extraction.
- **Doctor recommendations** by mapping predicted illnesses to doctor specializations.
- **User, Doctor, and Admin accounts** with role-based access and document verification for doctors.
- **Secure private chat system** where users can request to chat with doctors (doctors can approve or decline).
